## ❓ Why Locally Uncensored?

Tired of switching between Ollama for chat, ComfyUI for images, and another tool for video? Frustrated with bloated UIs that need Docker and a PhD to set up?

**Locally Uncensored** is the all-in-one solution. One app. One setup. Everything local.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Windows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
setup.bat
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The setup script automatically:
1. Checks for Node.js 18+, Git, and Ollama
2. Installs missing dependencies
3. Downloads a recommended uncensored AI model (~5.7 GB)
4. Starts the app in your browser

### Manual Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PurpleDoubleD/locally-uncensored.git
cd locally-uncensored
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — the app recommends models on first launch.

### Image & Video Generation

No separate installation needed! When you open the **Create** tab:

1. The app checks for ComfyUI automatically
2. If not found, click **"Install ComfyUI Automatically"** — it clones, installs dependencies, and sets up CUDA in one click
3. Go to **Model Manager → Discover → Image/Video** and click **Install All** on any model bundle
4. Generate images and videos — everything is ready

The entire setup happens inside the app. No terminal commands, no manual config files.

### One-Click Start (Windows)

```batch
start.bat
```

Launches Ollama + ComfyUI + the app in one go.

## 🧠 Model Auto-Detection

The app automatically detects all installed models across all backends — no manual configuration needed:

- **Text models** — Auto-detected from Ollama. On first launch, the app scans your hardware and recommends the best uncensored models for your system.
- **Image models** — Auto-detected from ComfyUI's `models/checkpoints` folder. Drop any checkpoint in there and it shows up instantly.
- **Video models** — Auto-detected from ComfyUI. The app identifies your video backend (Wan 2.1/2.2 or AnimateDiff) and lists available models automatically.

Just install models in the standard locations and the app picks them up.
