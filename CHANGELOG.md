# Changelog

All notable changes to Locally Uncensored are documented here.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **LM Studio (and other openai-compat backends) now show up when Ollama is also running** — `AppShell`'s post-onboarding detection only auto-enabled a backend when exactly one was detected. With two or more (the very common Ollama + LM Studio setup) it showed the `BackendSelector` modal but pre-enabled nothing. Users who dismissed the modal saw zero LM Studio models in the chat dropdown even though LM Studio was clearly running — looked from the outside like "LU doesn't recognize my models". Reported via Discord `#help-chat` on 2026-04-21. Fix: the first non-Ollama detected backend is always pre-enabled (Ollama is left untouched since it has its own provider slot); the selector stays as an educational picker so you can change which openai-compat backend is primary. Reproduced live with a mock LM Studio endpoint on port 1234 with Ollama also running, verified the fix against the same setup on the release binary. Five regression tests in `AppShell-backend-autoenable.test.ts`.
- **No more terminal flashes on Windows when LU kills subprocesses** — two Windows-branch `Command::new` spawns were missing `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`: the `taskkill` calls in `AppState::Drop` that tear down ComfyUI + Claude Code process trees on LU shutdown, and the `docker pull` / `docker run` in `search.rs` that installs SearXNG. Both briefly flashed a console window at the user. Now 100% of Windows-branch subprocess spawns carry the flag. LU itself never spawns LM Studio (only talks HTTP to a user-run instance), so the "no terminal when using LM Studio" guarantee was already true on that path; this tightens the peripheral surface.
- **`setup.bat` / `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` no longer mislead end-users into dev mode** — the scripts launched `npm run dev` (Vite + browser), which has fewer features than the installed Tauri app and produced confusing `[vite] http proxy error: /system_stats ECONNREFUSED` when ComfyUI wasn't installed yet. Reported via GitHub issue #30. Fix: all three setup scripts now start with a clear dev-mode banner, a link to the installer in Releases, and a one-key prompt to continue or exit. The README's "Windows One-Click Setup" section was also reframed as "For Contributors — Dev-Mode Setup" with an explicit pointer to the installer for end-users.

### Changed
- Test suite 2161 → 2166 green (+5 regression tests for the backend-autoenable fix).

### Notes
- Drop-in upgrade from v2.3.4. No breaking changes. No localStorage migration. Everything from v2.3.4 (chat-history persistence, Ollama 0.21 compat, Codex loop guard, stop-button fast-path, stale-chip fix, 12-backend auto-detect, Mobile Remote, Codex streaming, Agent Mode rewrite, ERNIE-Image, Qwen 3.6, 75+ one-click model downloads) still applies.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Chat history now survives updates** — `isTauri()` was checking the v1 global `window.__TAURI__`, but Tauri 2 renamed it to `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. Inside the packaged `.exe` every Tauri-only backend command (`backup_stores`, `restore_stores`, `set_onboarding_done`, ComfyUI manager, whisper, process control) silently fell through to the dev-mode fetch path and no-op'd. Fix: dual-global check + 100 ms × 50-tick polling loop that waits for the Tauri global to appear before arming the backup triad (required because `withGlobalTauri: true` sets the global asynchronously on slow cold-starts). Full destructive wipe+restore roundtrip live-verified on the release binary.
- **Backup cadence tightened** — safety-net interval 30 s → 5 s; added event-driven debounced backup on every chat mutation (1 s after the last message); added `beforeunload` sync flush for graceful quits. All three legs run unconditionally with a `__ts` marker so the snapshot is always non-empty.
- **Ollama 0.21 / 0.20.7 compatibility** — auto-upgraded Ollama rejects pre-existing models with `HTTP 404 model not found` on `/api/show` when the on-disk manifest lacks the `capabilities` field. New `modelHealthStore` + top-of-app `StaleModelsBanner` + Header Lichtschalter chip detect stale models and offer a one-click re-pull that verifies the fix before clearing the warning. Error parser tolerates 400/404/Rust-proxy-wrapped-500 forms.
- **Stale-chip state leak** — switching from a stale model to a fresh one now clears the red toggle and the inline chip immediately; switching between two different stale models re-pins correctly.
- **Codex infinite-loop guard** — small 3 B coder models (qwen2.5-coder:3b, llama3.2:1b) could loop forever repeating the same `file_write + shell_execute` batch when a test failed. Codex now tracks per-iteration batch signatures and halts after two consecutive identical batches with "same tool sequence repeated N× — try a larger model".
- **Stop button instant** — `abort.signal.aborted` checked at the top of the `for await` chat stream and the NDJSON reader loop; `reader.cancel()` on abort. No more 30–60 s of thinking-token leak after clicking Stop on a Gemma-4 response.
- **`isHtmlSnippet` export missing** — 19 failing CodeBlock tests fixed.
- **Create view crashed silently in browser bundle** — `comfyui.getKnownFileSizes` used CommonJS `require('../api/discover')` which Vite/Rolldown can't resolve. Replaced with dynamic `import()`.
- **flux2 CFG scale test regression** — test asserted 3.5 (Z-Image default); corrected to 1.0 (flux2 default).

### Changed
- Test suite 2105 → 2161 green (+56 regression tests covering backup triad, Codex loop detection, `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` detection, stale-manifest parsing).

### Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing chats and settings survive the upgrade via the now-working restore path.
- Existing `phi4:14b`, `dolphin3:8b`, and other pre-0.15 Ollama models will show in the stale banner. Click "Refresh all" to re-pull; manifests will be regenerated with the new `capabilities` field.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Model unloading broken** — unload button and automatic unload on model switch silently failed (missing `prompt` field in Ollama `/generate` call), causing models to stay in RAM indefinitely
- **No GPU offloading** — models ran entirely on CPU/RAM instead of GPU; added `num_gpu: 99` to all Ollama chat calls so layers are offloaded to GPU automatically (Ollama splits between GPU and CPU if VRAM is insufficient)
- **Silent error swallowing** — unload errors were caught and discarded with `.catch(() => {})`; now logged to console for debugging

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Agent Mode (Beta)** — AI can use tools: web_search, web_fetch, file_read, file_write, code_execute, image_generate
- **Two-phase search** — web_search finds URLs, web_fetch reads actual page content for accurate answers
- **Tool approval system** — safe tools auto-execute, dangerous tools require user confirmation
- **Live tool-call blocks** — inline status with expandable arguments and results
- **Agent onboarding tutorial** — 4-step walkthrough for first-time users
- **Memory system** — auto-saves tool results, keyword search, category filters, export/import as .md
- **Context compaction** — automatic message compression to prevent context window overflow
- **Model auto-fix** — abliterated models get tool-calling template restored via Ollama Modelfile
- **Hermes XML fallback** — prompt-based tool calling for models without native support
- **Persona dropdown** — quick persona switching in chat top bar
- **Variant selector** — dropdown for multi-size model downloads in Discover
- **HOT/AGENT badges** — recommended models highlighted in Model Manager
- **web_fetch tool** — fetches URLs and extracts readable text content (HTML → text)

### Changed
- **UI redesign (Linear/Arc style)** — compact header, collapsible settings, list-view models, minimal borders
- **Sidebar** — narrower, minimal hover states, smaller text
- **Settings** — collapsible sections, inline sliders, compact toggles
- **Model Manager** — list layout instead of card grid
- **Start screen** — clean LU logo only, smooth transition to chat
- **Header** — renamed to LUncensored, removed old Agents tab
- **Tool call display** — inline colored text instead of colored boxes

### Fixed
- DuckDuckGo search snippet truncation (regex now captures full HTML content)
- DDG URL extraction from redirect wrappers
- Context window exhaustion after many tool calls ("Failed to fetch" error)

### Removed
- Old standalone Agent View (replaced by in-chat Agent Mode)
